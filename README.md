Mini Project: Mental Health in Tech Based on OSMI Mental Health Survey

Created by: Sangeeth M

OSMI stands for Open Sourcing Mental Illness, the organization that runs the Mental Health in Tech Survey each year.

1.Project Title

“Gender-based Mental Health Analysis in Tech Professionals”

Mental Health in the Tech Industry

1️)Why It Matters

The tech industry is fast-paced, highly competitive, and constantly evolving. While it provides exciting opportunities, it also places heavy mental and emotional demands on professionals. Mental health in tech is not just a personal issue, but a workplace and organizational concern because it directly impacts productivity, innovation, and employee retention.

2️)Common Mental Health Challenges in Tech

Anxiety & Stress: Tight deadlines, long hours, and demanding clients/projects.

Burnout: Continuous pressure, lack of work-life balance, and always being "on call."

Depression: Isolation (especially for remote workers), lack of social support, or toxic workplace culture.

Imposter Syndrome: Many tech professionals feel they are “not good enough” despite being skilled.

Stigma: Fear of being judged or discriminated against if mental health issues are disclosed.

2.Domain

Healthcare / Workplace Mental Health / Data Analysis

3.Objective

To explore how gender, organizational support, and workplace culture affect mental health issues such as anxiety and depression among tech professionals.

4.Research Questions

Does gender influence the likelihood of experiencing mental health challenges?

How does organizational support impact employee well-being?

What are the common anxiety triggers in the tech workplace?

Research Question Answers

1️)Does gender influence the likelihood of experiencing mental health challenges?

Yes, gender has an influence.

Female and non-binary respondents report higher levels of anxiety, stress, and treatment-seeking compared to males.

Men are less likely to seek treatment, possibly due to stigma.

This suggests that gender-sensitive mental health support systems are needed.

2)How does organizational support impact employee well-being?

Organizational support has a strong positive impact.

Employees whose companies provide mental health benefits, HR policies, and awareness programs show lower anxiety and higher openness to seek help.

Workplaces without mental health policies often see employees hide struggles or avoid treatment.

Conclusion: Employer-provided support reduces stigma, encourages treatment, and improves overall well-being.

3️)What are the common anxiety triggers in the tech workplace?

The survey and analysis highlight key workplace anxiety triggers:

Long working hours and poor work-life balance.

High job demands with little flexibility.

Lack of supportive organizational culture (managers/HR not trained in mental health awareness).

Fear of being judged or discriminated against for disclosing mental health issues.

Limited or no access to counseling or therapy resources.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and visualizing data before applying advanced models. It helps us:

*Understand the structure of the dataset.

*Detect missing values, outliers, or errors.

*Identify patterns, relationships, and trends.

*Answer key research questions.

9.Conclusion

The OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey analysis shows that:

Gender Differences Exist:

Women and non-binary professionals report higher anxiety and mental health struggles compared to men.

This indicates that gender-sensitive support systems are needed in workplaces.

Organizational Support Matters:

Employees with access to clear mental health policies and HR support are less likely to suffer from untreated anxiety or depression.

Lack of support increases workplace stress and stigma.

Main Anxiety Triggers Identified:

Long working hours & poor work-life balance.

Fear of being judged when disclosing mental health issues.

Limited or no employer-provided mental health resources.

Recommendations for Organizations:

Introduce mental health awareness training for managers.

Provide counseling services and ensure anonymity.

Promote flexible working options to reduce stress.

Mental health is a critical factor in the tech industry because the job demands can easily lead to anxiety, stress, or burnout. Companies that invest in mental health support not only improve the well-being of employees but also gain higher productivity, innovation, and loyalty.
